<h1>Restaurant Menu </h1>
<p>You have been hired by a local restaurant to develop an online ordering system for customers.
    The restaurant's menu is listed below.
    You must show all of the menu items and give customers a way to add them to the cart.
    After adding an item, customers should be able to remove specific items or add a special request.
    The special request should be able to change as needed.
    The owner has tasked you with tracking one more piece of information about the items
    in cart to help them properly prepare the order.
</p>
