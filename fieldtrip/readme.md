## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary
Brief description of your what your project is about and why you chose that topic.

Blacks in the West: the Stories Behind the Art is an exhibit at the Eitlejorg museum
presented by volunteer guide Gayle Cox. The exhibit showcases painted depictions of African
Americans throughout history in Western attire and living a lifestyle similar to
depictions seen in Western movies. Gayle Cox emphasizes how Black Americans were a significant part
of real Western history, but she seldom saw them depicted in country Western shows. The exhibit sets
out to rectify the discrepancy between real history and artistic depictions.

For this project, I would build a series of simple interactive webpages to showcase
each painting, the artists, and a description of the painting/the historical context
that informed the painting.

### Core Webpages
List core webpages and briefly describe the page of them. Include intractable features for the web app.

-Watercolor Painting of Black Man in Military Uniform Page (Painting 1)
-User would then click the -> and see a picture of the artist (Dean Mitchell)
as well as a brief biography
-The user would click -> again and see a video accessed via the Youtube Data API
about the historical context of the painting.
-There would be more pages doing this method with each painting from
the exhibit

-Index would be the landing page from the internet. It would introduce the
exhibit and have links to each painting page

### Design Choices
List any websites that you might reference to influence your styling choices. List any colors used and what they were used for.

-Colors from the David Hammons African American flag would be used throughout the website.
The background would be white in order to reduce contrast. The -> button would be red and the
words would be black.

Design inspiration would be from the website for
The National Museum of African American History and Culture (https://nmaahc.si.edu)
